# Logo Source Guidance

## Source Priority

1. Official brand pages / press kits
- Best source for legal clarity and correct latest branding.
- Use when available.

2. SVGL (`https://svgl.app/`)
- Fast for developer workflows and common SaaS logos.
- Good default for web UI implementation.

3. Simple Icons (`https://simpleicons.org/`)
- Good for uniform icon sets.
- Usually icon-focused variants, not always official wordmarks.

## Selection Checklist

- Source trust: official first, then reputable aggregator.
- Asset quality: valid SVG with proper `viewBox`.
- Visual consistency: variant matches nearby logos in the same UI.
- Legal note: include trademark/licensing caveat when needed.

## Licensing Notes

- Brand logos are typically trademarks even when downloadable.
- Treat logos as brand assets, not generic open media.
- If terms are not obvious, flag for manual legal/brand confirmation.
